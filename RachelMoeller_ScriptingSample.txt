Scripting Sample: Devil's Diction

This is a C# sample from my 2D RPG, Devil's Diction. It's an excerpt from
the questManager script, commented for context to show the way I structured 
quests. I built this system to accomodate 6 quests that progress when the 
player completes a dialogue tree with a certain NPC.

This excerpt is the quest "Mudslingers," in which the leaders of two
opposing towns in the rural American south recruit the player to play
a malicious prank on the other.

//QUEST START:Player met Phantasma, the witch who serves as the mayor of the supernatural town.

		that serves as it's economic stability.
	//Initialize new quest object. Quests are data structures that encapsulate the player's
	//journal info, NPC behaviors (do they move? their default dialogue?), map markers,
	//and the following quest at a given point. Quests are really just "quest steps" in a
	//sort of linked list.

	//A list of all possible lines that can appear in the player's journal after they complete this step.
